![Project Euler Logo](https://projecteuler.net/themes/20210601/logo_default.png)

This repository contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems using Python programming language. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require innovative solutions. This repository serves as a collection of my implementations, providing a reference for others and showcasing my problem-solving skills.

## Project Euler

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. The problems are designed to be solved using programming, providing a platform for improving programming skills while exploring various mathematical concepts.

Each problem in Project Euler is independent and requires an efficient solution algorithm. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including number theory, combinatorics, algebra, and more.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each problem, named in the format `problemXXX`, where `XXX` represents the problem number. Within each directory, you will find a Python script `script.py` that contains my solution to the respective problem.

```
Project-Euler
├── 1. Multiples of 3 or 5
│   └── script.py
├── 2. ...
│   └── ...
├── 3. ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Feel free to explore the solutions, analyze the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

## Usage

To run the solutions on your local machine, make sure you have Python installed. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-Euler.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the specific problem you want to execute:

```bash
cd Project-Euler/1. Multiples of 3 or 5
```

Run the Python script:

```bash
python script.py
```

Replace `1. Multiples of 3 or 5` with the name of the problem directory you want to run.
